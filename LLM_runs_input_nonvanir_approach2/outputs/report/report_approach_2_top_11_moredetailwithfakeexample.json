Ensure your corrections maintain or achieve the intended security remediation.\n\nSTRICT FORMATTING AND OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:\n*   **Markdown Diff Block**: Your entire response MUST be a single markdown code block of type 'diff'. Start with ```diff (with a newline after it) and end with ```.\n*   **No Extra Text**: Absolutely NO explanations, NO comments, NO apologies, NO summaries, or any other text outside this single ```diff ... ``` block.\n*   **Diff Content - Headers**: Inside the block, the diff MUST start with `--- a/FILENAME` and `+++ b/FILENAME` lines, where FILENAME is the target filename provided to you in the task.\n*   **Diff Content - Hunk Structure and Line Counts**:\n    *   You MUST generate hunks that precisely match the line counts implied by the input `.rej` file's hunk headers (e.g., `@@ -old_start,old_lines +new_start,new_lines @@`).\n    *   The output hunk should contain `old_lines` from the original (prefixed with ' ' for context, '-' for removed) and `new_lines` for the patched version (prefixed with ' ' for context, '+' for added).\n    *   Do NOT add extraneous context lines beyond what is necessary to make the patch apply cleanly and match the implied line counts.\n*   **Diff Content - Line Prefixes**: Every content line *within* a diff hunk (after the `@@ ... @@` header) MUST start with a ' ' (space for context), '-' (for removed lines), or '+' (for added lines).\n*   **No Nested Code Blocks**: Do NOT use further markdown code fences (like ```) *inside* the main diff content.\n\nExample of the complete expected output structure:\n```diff\n--- a/example.txt\n+++ b/example.txt\n@@ -1,3 +1,3 @@\n context line\n-old line\n+new line\n context line\n```\n",
