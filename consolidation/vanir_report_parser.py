    Parser for Vanir security vulnerability reports.
    
    This class is responsible for:
    1. Loading raw Vanir vulnerability reports in JSON format
    2. Extracting structured information about security patches
    3. Organizing patch data by affected files and functions
    4. Saving the processed data in a structured format for further processing
    
    The parser extracts key information such as:
    - Patch URLs (from Googlesource or CodeLinaro)
    - Commit hashes from patch URLs
    - Affected files and functions
    
    The output is a structured JSON file that maps patches to their affected files,
    which is used by subsequent modules for downloading and applying patches.

        parser = VanirParser('path/to/vanir_report.json')
