Patch Fetcher Runner

This script orchestrates the batch downloading of patches identified in the
Vanir report. It reads the structured report data, processes each patch entry,
and downloads the corresponding patch files.

This is the main entry point for the patch downloading process, which:
1. Reads the parsed Vanir report
2. For each patch, extracts the URL and affected files
3. Calls the fetch_patch function to download and filter the patch
4. Reports success or failure for each patch

The script handles errors for individual patches and continues processing
the remaining patches even if some fail.
