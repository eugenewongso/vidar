r"""Enriches a filtered report with upstream patch data from a reference report.

This script performs a data enrichment task by merging information from two
separate reports. It takes a primary report (e.g., a filtered list of failures
for a specific Android version) and enriches it with detailed upstream patch
information (like the full patch content and commit hashes) from a more
comprehensive reference report (e.g., a combined report of all failures).

The process is as follows:
1.  Loads the main data file and the reference data file.
2.  Creates a fast lookup dictionary from the reference report, keyed by the
    vulnerability ID.
3.  Iterates through each entry in the main data file.
4.  Uses the vulnerability ID to find the corresponding entry in the reference
    report.
5.  If a match is found, it copies the `upstream_patch_content`,
    `upstream_commits`, and `upstream_patch_tokens` fields from the reference
    entry into the main entry.
6.  Saves the newly enriched data to a specified output file.

Usage:
  python extract_upstream_patch_data.py \
      --main-file <path_to_filtered_report.json> \
      --reference-file <path_to_comprehensive_report.json> \
      --output-file <path_to_enriched_report.json>
