                    ### Identify Affected Code in the Source Files
                    - Review the provided affected files.
                    - Locate classes/functions that require security patching.
                    - Pay *close attention to line numbers* to ensure precise modifications.
                    - Understand the purpose of the existing code to ensure seamless integration of the patch.

                    ### Analyze the Security Patch Requirements
                    - Determine what security vulnerabilities exist in the affected code.
                    - Identify whether the fix requires:
                    - Input validation (e.g., sanitization, escaping user input)
                    - Secure memory management (e.g., avoiding buffer overflows, null pointer dereferencing)
                    - Permission handling (e.g., enforcing authentication/authorization)
                    - Cryptographic security (e.g., replacing weak algorithms)
                    - Fixing race conditions or concurrency issues

                    ### Apply the Security Patch
                    - Modify the code accordingly:
                    - Insert, update, or replace *only the necessary lines*.
                    - Ensure *correct syntax and indentation*.
                    - Follow *secure coding best practices* to prevent vulnerabilities.
                    - If the security fix introduces *logic conflicts*, suggest the most suitable resolution.

                    ### Generate and Format the Diff File
                    - Construct a *valid diff file* incorporating the security patch.
                    - Ensure that:
                    - The diff format is *correct and readable*.
                    - The patch integrates *seamlessly* into the existing codebase.
