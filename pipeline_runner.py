r"""Main pipeline orchestrator for the Vanir Patch Management System.

This script serves as the master runner for the entire patch processing workflow.
It executes a series of modules in a predefined sequence to parse vulnerability
reports, fetch required patches, attempt to apply them, and use an LLM to
correct any patches that fail.

The pipeline is designed to be run from the root of the `vidar` directory.

Usage:
